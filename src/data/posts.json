    "content": "Psalm 1:2 describes the “happy” person as one whose “delight is in the instruction of the Lord, and on his instruction he meditates day and night.” The Hebrew word for “meditate” here isn’t about emptying your mind, but about filling it—chewing on God’s words, letting them shape your thoughts, desires, and actions. It’s not a legalistic box to check, but a way of life that leads to true happiness and resilience. Our delight is what we meditate and feed on! If you are hearing this and that’s not you today—you don’t delight in God’s word. That’s okay! Where you are today does not have to be where you are tomorrow! That’s gospel! That’s good news! Treat this like an experiment.",
